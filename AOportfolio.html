    <h1><b>A Little Bit About Me</b></h1>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Anahi Ojeda. My dad was the one who chose my name, and I kind of almost resented him for it growing up.
            Almost everyone I meet always has a difficult time pronouncing my name,
            let alone remember it. That's how it's always been growing up.
            It used to bother me when I was younger when I moved away from the city and into the suburbs, 
            but it doesn't anymore. I just appreciate it when people at least try. 
            I've researched the origin of the name "Anahi", I found out it has Persian roots and means "immortal". 
            I think that's pretty badass. 
        </p><br>
        <p>I was born in Chicago and grew up in Humboldt Park. Both of my parents immigrated from Mexico, 
            making me first generation Mexican-American. I have a huge family with a BUNCH of cousins; over 30.</p><br>
        <p>I big hobby of mine is painting. I started off with just drawing and then picked up watercolors more seriously
            about 7 years ago. So I have a pretty cool colletion of art supplies. I realized the reason 
            I like painting so much, is because it is truly the only time my brain shuts <B>EVERYTHING</B> out.
            I do not think about drama. I do not have ruminating thoughts. It's just me in my own little world
            with colors.
        </p><br>
    <h2>I Love Traveling !</h2>
        <p>I know it probably sounds a bit cliche or eye-rolling to hear someone say they love to travel,
            but the reason why I love it is because it has truly opened my mind and eyes and has made me a better person
            in a way. I am grateful in way I cannot begin to describe for the experiences I've had with the people from
            the countries I've been to.<br>
            <b>Here is a list of the countries I've visited:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Mexico</li>
                <li>Canada</li>
                <li>Italy</li>
                <li>Austria</li>
                <li>Germany</li>
                <li>Slovenia</li>
                <li>France</li>
                <li>England</li>
                <li>San Marino (it's a small country in the middle Italy, they speak Italian,
                    but they don't consider themselves Italian...)</li>
                <li>Greece</li>
                <li>Jordan (by far my favorite!)</li>
            </ul><br>
        <p>It's mainly been in Europe and a bunch different places in Mexico/Italy, but I want to move more East in 
            the near future.</p><br>
        <p>But my heart will always stay in Mexico where my grandparents are from.</p>
